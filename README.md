# How to Install

With Garlic OS installed, download the ZIP and choose what theme to use (MonoScreen Light, MonoScreen Dark, MonoScreen Light Boxart or MonoScreen Dark Boxart) replace the `boot_logo.bmp.gz` in the first partition, and the `CFW` folder in the last partition.

The Boxart themes (MonoScreen Light Boxart and MonoScreen Dark Boxart) already have the game list aligned to the righ, but you have to set up the boxart for yourself, Retro Game Corps has a [easy guide](https://retrogamecorps.com/2023/01/03/anbernic-rg35xx-starter-guide/#Boxart) on how to do it.
